      <p>My name is Madison Morris and I am a full stack web developer student at the University of Miami coding bootcamp. I have spent the last two years working as a nanny and personal assistant, but I have recently decided to follow in the path of my mom and sister and transition into Web development. When Iâ€™m not working I am always trying new things. I really enjoy being outdoors, rollerblading and traveling. 
      I am focusing my goals on finishing school, searching for web development positions, and networking. I am a huge people person and I love learning from others and helping to solve problems. My development skills including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Java, Database Theory, MongoDB, Heroku, Git and more. This is just the beginning for my future in web development and I am excited to learn more and network with everyone. You can connect with me on Linkedin for networking and more!  </p>
